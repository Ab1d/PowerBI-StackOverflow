#How to contribute

Contributing to the PowerBI-StackOverflow repo is easy

1. Fork the repo to your GitHub Account
2. Commit to your fork's develop branch
3. Pull request from your fork's develop branch to PowerBI-StackOverflow's develop branch

It's just me working on this; no commmitte to review changes, so turnaround will be fast.
